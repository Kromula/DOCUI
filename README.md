# DOCUI
My UI for World of Warcraft. With the upcoming Addon Apocolypse I will likely be reverting to default UI like everyone else. 

I have already started making layouts and designs for my UI now, during The War Within. 

## Features
- Layouts for Tank/DPS and healers
- Optimised for 1440p (This is assuming Blizzard add proper scaling into Midnight, if not I have made a 1440p scaling addon I will add here)
- Layouts and setups for cooldown manager.
